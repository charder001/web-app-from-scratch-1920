## What does your app do, what is the goal?
This app provides the user with a weather forecast and a gif based on said forecast.

## Which actors are there in your application?
The API will be used to fetch data to inject into the HTML
My app will turn the returned JSON into HTML elements and content
The HTML on the page will be used to gather inputs which can be used to make API calls.

## Which API is used and what are the limitations?
For this app i will be using the Dark Sky API. I chose the dark sky API because it was recommended by our teachers. It is really easy to work with and has decent documentation. The API allows 1,000 free calls each day.

I will also use the GIPHY API to fetch all of the imagery needed for this app.

## API requests
This app fetches the following data from the dark-sky and giphy API

- Weather temperature, precipitation chance and intensity.
- Gifs based on a search query

## What have i learned?
- ### Working with API's
I had never worked with an externaly API, so actually getting some real data to work with was really nice. I found the darksky and giphy API's really easy to work with and would reccomend them to anyone. 

- ### Fetching
This was also my first time using fetch requests. I had written a few old school http requests during my tech course, but most of my knowladge from this period has since departed my brain. This was really difficult for me, because it felt like i should know how most of these things work by now, but i find myself overestimating my skillset and what i'm actually capable of in this area sadly.

- ### Templating
I have limited experience with templating engines. During my internship i had to use the templating engine Twig, which was pretty different from what i used for this app, which turned out to be an interesting challenge. 

- ### Routing
Routing is something i had never done before, and wnile at first i could not really see the point, i now know the great potential that comes with routing and will definitely be using it more often. 

- ### Modular coding
During my tech course last year, the code i worked in was modular, but it was written by a team member. I knew how to work with modular code, but had never written or made some myself. I love how much easier it is to debug and when working in a team project, avoids conflcts.
