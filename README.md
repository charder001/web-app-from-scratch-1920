## What does your app do, what is the goal?
This will be a weather app where people can add locations to their dashboard and see the forecast for those locations.
The application will also feature a detail page for each specific location with a more in-depth forecast.

## Which actors are there in your application?
The API will be used to fetch data to inject into the HTML
My app will turn the returned JSON into HTML elements and content
The HTML on the page will be used to gather inputs which can be used to make API calls.

## Which API is used and what are the limitations?
For this app i will be using the Dark Sky API. I chose the dark sky API because it was recommended by our teachers. It is really easy to work with and has decent documentation. The API allows 1,000 free calls each day.

## API requests
This app fetches the following data from the dark-sky and giphy API

- Weather temperature, precipitation chance and intensity.
- Gifs based on a search query

## How does the interaction flow through the application?

## Which design patterns and best practices

## What would you like to add
Detail page
Functionality to add more locations
Routing
Templating
